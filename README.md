# TLSTMS

Time aware LSTM networks for playing with conflict prediction 

## Notes 
T-LSTMS modulate the time progression between differing sequence steps. This was intended for use in patient records - where temporal proximity between symptoms may indicate significance. This is again relevant to conflicts when considering the proximity of conflcit events on the progression of conflict intensity.
